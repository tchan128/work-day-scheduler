    <h3 align="center">Work Day Scheduler</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to build upon pre-existing source code to make a usable workday scheduler. I built this project because as an individual with many things going on during a work day, it is nice to have space to organize myself and my events/appointments. Having a space that allows me to keep myself organized and acts as a day tracker really helps me stay focused. Through this project, I learned how to use jQuery to easily change and modify different class and elements in the HTML. I also learned how to better use local storage. Lastly, I learned how to use different APIs.

## About the Project

This project is a workday scheduler. This project is built with mainly JavaScript, but the HTML and CSS were built out prior. This workday scheduler allows users to display events that will be happening during their 9-5 workday. Users can modify events and save them locally so that it opens up the next time it saves what they have input. It will also display how many more hours are remaining in the work day. Lastly, it will show users which hours/events have passed and which hour/event is currently happening.

## Installation

Nothing is needed to install this project. It is deployed on pages through Gitlab and can be accessed online. If this is being used as a template or source code for refactoring, one can download the code or clone the source code to their own repository.

## Usage

In this project, a pre-existing source code is modified to create a workday scheduler. This workday scheduler allows users to display events that will be happening during their 9-5 workday. Users will be shown blocks for their 9-5 work day. Grey will signify hours that have passed, red will signify the current hour, and green will signify the future hours. Users can tap on the text area and press the save button/icon on the right of each block to save the event. The user will know that the event is saved as a confirmation will appear after submission. When events/hours are grey, meaning they have passed, they can no longer be modified. Everything refreshes at midnight and local storage will be cleared and empty for the next work day.

## Visuals

Here is a picture of how local storage stores the event. It will store each event in a different key.
