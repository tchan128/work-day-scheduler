    <h3 align="center">Work Day Scheduler</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to build upon pre-existing source code to make a usable work day scheduler. I built this project because as an individual with many things going on during a work day, it is nice to a space to organize myself and my events/appointments. Having a space that allows me to keep myself organize and acts as a day tracker really helps me stay focus. Through this project, I learned how to use jQuery to easily change and modify different elements in the HTML. I also learned how to better use local storage. Lastly, I learned how to use different APIs.

## About the Project

This project is a work day scheduler. This project is build with mainly javascript, but the HTML and CSS was built out prior. This work day scheduler allows users to display events that will be happening during their 9-5 work day. Users can modify events and save it locally so that it opens up next time it saves what they have input. It will also display how many more hours are remaining in the work day. Lastly, it will show users which hours/events have passed and which hour/event is currently happening.

## Usage

In this project, a pre-existing source code is modified to create a work day scheduler. This work day scheduler allows users to display events that will be happening during their 9-5 work day. Users will be shown blocks for one's 9-5 work day. Grey will signify hours that have passed, red will signify the current hour, and green will signify the future hours. Users can tap on the text area and press the save button/icon on the right of each block so save the event. The user will know that the event is saved as a confirmation will appear after submission. When events/hours are grey, meaning they have passed, they can no longer be modified. Everything refreshes at midnight and local storage will be cleared and empty for the next work day.
